## <span style="color: #F27D00">WARNING! Preliminary syllabus subject to change without notice. Stay tuned!</span> ##


## Textbook: ##

A collection of online resources will be used, but no textbook will be required.  Current blog posts and videos about the state of various technologies and best practices will be included in some assignments.  Peruse them to learn something.

## Slack ##

We will use [Slack](http://slack.com), an online collaborative tool for most class messaging and help. Details in class. We will also write slack integrations!

## Note about Grading ##

Grading of some collaborative team based work will be done based on GitHub pull requests.  Proper git flow will be introduced early on in the term.

  - 3 short assignments: 10%
  - 2 bi-weekly labs:  25%
  - Short in-class quizzes:  15%
  - 1 group presentation and workshop: 10%
  - 1 final project:  30%
  - Participation:  5%
  - Peer mentoring: 5%

## Software ##

We will use open source development tools and frameworks.  Note: These will work on OS X and Linux. For Windows they can also be done on a cloud based IDE (details in short assignment 1).

## Honor principle -- Not your standard warning! ##

The web is an open place and there is a lot of code out there.  We want you to be able to show your work and to be proud of the code you have written.  To this end, all your work will be on GitHub (which you will learn about).  However, you do need to learn and as such all the code for the labs and for your portion of the final project will need to actually be written by you.

For the short assignments and the labs you may verbally collaborate as much as you want. However, the code that you commit (turn in), should be created, typed, documented, and output generated, by you. You may consult freely with instructors and classmates but you should work individually when actually coding.  

During the debugging stage you may discuss your problems with others in the class, but you should not copy code to fix bugs. To do otherwise is a violation of the Academic Honor Principle. If you work with a classmate on any assignment, you should tell us who you worked with in a comment at the top of your code.  You may scour the internet / [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for help with  also, but you must credit any solutions you find in comments in your code specifying where you found them and what you took from them.  If you copy/paste code without attribution you are violating the Academic Honor Principle. You will not be penalized for copied code as long as it is properly attributed and a significant portion of your project was still written by you. Obviously if you copy/paste the whole project â€” there will be bad consequences.  Similarly do not copy/paste from other students work. Discuss as much as you want, but do not copy.  

## Special accommodations and Religious observances##

Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible.  Similarly for Religious observances please talk to the staff as early as possible to resolve any conflicts.
