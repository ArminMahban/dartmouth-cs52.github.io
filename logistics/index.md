## Textbook ##

A collection of online resources will be used, but no textbook will be required.  Current blog posts and videos about the state of various technologies and best practices will be included in some assignments.  Peruse them to learn something.

## Auditing ##

Unfortunately due to the nature of the class and our classroom size, auditing the class will not be permitted. All class material will be posted here online though!

## Slack ##

We will use [Slack](http://slack.com), an online collaborative tool for most class messaging and help. Details in class. We will also write slack integrations!

## Grading ##

Grading of some collaborative team based work will be done based on GitHub pull requests.  Proper git flow will be introduced early on in the term.

  - 4 short assignments: 10%
  - 4 week-long labs:  20%
  - 4 short in-class quizzes:  16%
  - 1 group presentation and workshop: 10%
  - 1 final project:  30%
  - Participation:  9%
  - Peer mentoring: 5%

  * late penalty:
    * -1% of assignment per hour
    * 2 allowed re-submits (capped at 80%)


## Software ##

We will use open source development tools and frameworks.  Note: These will work out of the box in macOS and Linux, and should work ok with a bit of coercion in Windows (tested in Win10).  (details in short assignment 1)

## Honor principle -- Not your standard warning! ##

The web is an open place and there is a lot of code out there.  We want you to be able to show your work and to be proud of the code you have written.  To this end, all your work will be on GitHub.  However, you do need to learn and as such all the code for the labs and for your portion of the final project will need to actually be written by you.

### The Internet

The Internet will be a large source of information and help to you as you do your assignments in this class.  We want to encourage you to scour the internet / [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for help, **but** you **must credit** any solutions you find in comments in your code specifying where you found them and what you took from them.  If you copy/paste code without attribution you are violating the Academic Honor Principle, and we hope you enjoy your 3 term vacation.  You will **not** be penalized for copied code as long as it is **properly attributed** and some significant portion of your project was still written by you. Obviously don't copy/paste the whole project.

### Student Collaboration

For the short assignments and the labs you may verbally collaborate as much as you want. However, the code that you commit (turn in), should be created, typed, documented, and output generated, by you. You may consult freely with instructors and classmates but you should work individually when actually coding. You should never copy code from other students. Your peers are not considered an authorized source. Discuss as much as you want, but do not copy. To do otherwise is a violation of the Academic Honor Principle. Any collaboration with another student should be documented in the comments.  Again no penalty for mentioning that you talked to somebody, but if you did talk to someone and your code is very similar to theirs this will raise questions, better to clarify upfront.

## Citation Format

Make your in-code citations look something like this:

```
// adapted from: http://stackoverflow.com/someurl
// this method does x and y
```

(policy adapted from: https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code)


## Special accommodations and Religious observances##

Students with disabilities who may need disability-related academic adjustments and services for this course are encouraged to see me privately as early in the term as possible.  Similarly for Religious observances please talk to the staff as early as possible to resolve any conflicts.
