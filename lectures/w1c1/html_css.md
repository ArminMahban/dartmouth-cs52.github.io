# HyperText Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets


You all know some programming languages such as python and Java.  HTML is not like those.  

It is not a programming language at all. It is a descriptor language.  HTML describes the structure of a document semantically.  It has no operations or actions, so you can't compute with it, but you can define structure.  This is important. When someone says they can code in HTML, look at them funny. ðŸ˜‘

There are many markup language, you may have heard of or used latex and markdown.  The idea is: include some syntactically identifiable notation/descriptions in your document that can dictate presentation or describe content.

This document you are reading right now, was actually written in [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which is a very simple formatting language. For instance **this** is bold because I wrote `**this**`.

But let's talk HTML.

## Brief History

The year is 1990,  Tim Berners-Lee (not yet knighted!) puts write a bit of code and voila! Soup!

"I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas andâ€”ta-da!â€”the World Wide Web"

The basic idea of structural tags with links between documents has remained the same since then.


## Tags

HTML uses **tags** to describe structure.  Tags are designated by `< >` surrounding the tag.
Tags most often come in pairs. A start tag, `< tag >` and an ending tag `</tag>`.

Everything in between a pair of start and end tags can be thought of as the child/children of that tag.

This is because underneath it all, your HTML is parsed into a ___ .

Yes a tree!  Pretty much everything in this course is going to be a tree! :deciduous_tree:
This is important and we'll dive deeper into this next week.


### Examples



<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="24119" data-slug-hash="e6bad6db1a6fbebf4d365939d61926de" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="timofei" data-embed-version="2" data-editable="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/timofei/pen/e6bad6db1a6fbebf4d365939d61926de/">e6bad6db1a6fbebf4d365939d61926de</a> by Tim Tregubov (<a href="http://codepen.io/timofei">@timofei</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>


Some tags are *self-closing* and contain direct content such as the tag for images.









Most browsers happen to grant certain structural elements with default styles.  For instance I can put in `
