## Course Description

The Web is a powerful delivery tool for complex real-time applications. This is an introduction to full stack Web application development — the approach of integrating numerous techniques and technologies to build modern Web applications. Topics include: static pages, Internet protocols, layout, markup, event-driven asynchronous programming, deployment, security, scalability, and user experience. Projects include building real-time Web applications with front-end UIs and server-side APIs.

Prerequisites: CS10 or permission of instructor

## Overview

This is a new hands-on course that will introduce the state of the art (early 2016) of web development. We will code both inside and outside of class.  The class will be an adventure.  The goal of the class is for each and every one of you to be empowered with the skills and understanding necessary to build modern web technologies.  Web technologies are not only web pages — we will build chatbots and mobile apps and learn how IoT devices communicate using the web.  We will learn bleeding edge technologies and start to make sense of the myriad of tools and frameworks out there.
