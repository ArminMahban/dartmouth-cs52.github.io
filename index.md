## Course Overview

The Web is a powerful delivery tool for complex real-time applications. This is a new hands-on course that will introduce the state of the art (early 2016) of full-stack web development. You will learn to build not only interactive web applications, but also chatbots, and mobile apps. This class will be an adventure and requires active participation both inside and outside of class. There will be lab projects, exercises in class, and a collaborative final project.

By the end of term, you will:

  - understand the fundamental concepts of web application development
  - know the state of the art tools and frameworks used to build web technologies
  - build your own web applications with front-end UIs and server-side APIs

Topics include: static pages, Internet protocols, layout, markup, event-driven asynchronous programming, deployment, security, scalability, and user experience.
