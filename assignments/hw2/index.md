# Build a Slack Bot

Where we will learn some javascript along the way.

[Start here](https://github.com/dartmouth-cs52/slackattack)


## To Turn In:

* github url to your bots repo (must be readable by staff, can be public)
* screen caps of some conversations that test your bot's functionality
* when we talk to your bot, it should be able to:
  * respond to hi
  * return results for a restaurant query
  * carry on at least one conversation
  * send back an [*attachment* message](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit#botreply) in response to something.

# Extra Credit

* So many options. Be creative!
* Maps?
* Driving directions?
* [MongoDB Botkit Storage](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-storage-mongo) setup on Heroku.
