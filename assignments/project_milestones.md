The last 3 weeks of class will be dedicated to a group project.  This will be a project of your own devising, built from the ground up (but as always libraries/apis are allowed).  There are required components that you have to build as well a bunch of milestones. Best practices, group dynamics, agile, etc will all be on the menu.

  Signup to pitch your idea! (with a partner)

* **Pitch Presentation** (7/28/2016):<br>
  A 5 minute presentation with 5 minutes of Q&A to pitch your idea to the class. Everybody will rank their top choices and groups will be formed that way.

* **Feature Spec** (8/6/2016):<br>
  A walk-though of your project from the users perspective listing out every feature that it should have.

* **Scaffolding + Mockups** (8/9/2016):<br>
