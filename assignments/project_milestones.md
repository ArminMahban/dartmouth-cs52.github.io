# The Final Project

The last 3 weeks of class will be dedicated to a group project.  This will be a project of your own devising, built from the ground up (but as always libraries/apis are allowed).  There are required components that you have to build as well a bunch of milestones. Best practices, group dynamics, agile, etc will all be on the menu.


## Milestone Summary

* Pitch Proposals (due 7/21/2016):  This will be your chance to submit an idea that you would like to pitch.  As the person submitting the idea you'll need to think a little bit about scope and feasibility.  Deliverables: proposal form.
* Pitch Presentation (8/2/2016):  A 5 minute presentation with 5 minutes of Q&A to pitch your idea to the class. Deliverables: pitch deck.
* Feature Spec
Scaffolding + Mockups
Dev Site Up (client+server)
