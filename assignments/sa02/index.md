### To Turn In

1. URLs to github commits and pull requests. Its ok and normal to have several of these, you don't have to have gotten it right the first time. Requirements:
  * your github username and email are correctly set
  * you made a branch and did a pull request successfully into gh-pages
1. screen capture of the map and the html page you wrote running on localhost:9000 (ie a screen cap of your whole browser window with the url visible).

### Extra Credit

* Make your page more interesting than mine.
* Add in some CSS even though we haven't talked about it yet.
