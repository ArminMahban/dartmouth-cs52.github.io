Where we will learn some javascript along the way.



### To Turn In

1. github repo url
1. README.md available that describes what and how to test the bot in slack
1. a screen cap of a conversation with the bot
1. bot must:
   * respond to direct messages
   * call an external API
   * use promises
   * not use any c style for loops
   * be well commented

### Extra Credit

* Make your page more interesting than mine.
* Add in some CSS even though we haven't talked about it yet.
