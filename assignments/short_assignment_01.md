First things first.  You need a local development environment.  

*Why is this important you ask.  Couldn't I just copy code over to a server every time I make changes?  You could.  But imagine debugging,  every change you make you spend a few seconds maybe copying code over, or pushing git.  This time adds up.  Save yourself hours of your life, get your laptop set up for coding now.*


ðŸš€ indicates a step to do.

## Tools! ##

ðŸš€Install [atom](http://atom.io).  Atom is a code editor.  Atom is an open source, made by Github
web technology written in html+css+javascript using a platform called [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). Using Electron to create a desktop app is an option for the final project.  We'll be using Atom for coding and utilizing a lot of its plugins.

ðŸš€If you don't have it, install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/).  Why?
Because we'll be using [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) for debugging â€” more on that later.

ðŸš€Install [GitHub Desktop](http://desktop.github.com).  We will be mostly using ```git``` from the commandline but installing the App gives you a nice tree visualization.


### OS X ###

ðŸš€Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).  This is a package manager for all things open source.
We will use ```brew``` extensively to setup your dev environment.

### Various Linux ###

Most of the directions through the class will be very similar on the various flavors of linux.  Mostly just replace any ```brew``` command with the package manager for your system (apt on Ubuntu or yum on Fedora).

### Windows ###

Windows is a trickier dev environment.  We'll try to provide directions but these may need revision.
In general though whenever we refer to Terminal you can just use *Git Shell* (which comes bundled with the GitHub app).  You may want to check out [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org) for a package manager for Windows.

If you want to be brave you can try out the very new beta of [ubuntu in windows](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2016/04/06/bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-download-now-3/) â€” no guarantees there.
